# JIDTheme
Wordpress Theme Designed for the IADB

# About it

This theme was developed in order to update the website of the IADB, it is also my first wordpress theme so, 
feel free to provide me with any advice.

# What's next...

despite it is a theme developed for the IADB, it's going to be the last final release that I do to the WP Theme so, 
any other update or modification to the oficial webpage is not going to be commited in this repository.

# Finally...

This is my first time using GitHub and also as you can see, I am not a native english speaker so, be pacient with this stuff.

If you have any other interesting project related to Android Development, Java SE, Java EE, PHP and so on just let me know
and I would really appreciate to be part of it as well.
